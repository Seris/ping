/ â€œAnother thing that got forgotten was   \
| the fact that against all probability a |
| sperm whale had suddenly been called    |
| into existence several miles above the  |
| surface of an alien planet.             |
|                                         |
| And since this is not a naturally       |
| tenable position for a whale, this poor |
| innocent creature had very little time  |
| to come to terms with its identity as a |
| whale before it then had to come to     |
\ terms with not being a whale any more.  /
